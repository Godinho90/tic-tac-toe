# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

I have made a Tic Tac Toe from a Udemy course about Javascript from Matheus Battisti.
The game use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and it has 2 games modes: PVP and against the computer.

In the Player vs Player mode, two players can compete against each other on the same device. They take turns placing their respective marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The Player vs Computer mode allows a single player to challenge an AI opponent. The player can test their skills against the computer, which employs an algorithm to make strategic moves and provide a "challenging gameplay experience".

The game features provides visual feedback for successful moves, winning conditions, and draws.

Overall, the Tic Tac Toe game offers an enjoyable gaming experience and it was really nice to do it and test my ability to create interactive web applications.
